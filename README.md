# panic-web-app

This is v1.0.0 of Panic Web Application

Most of this version is intial design with few functional parts.

In the current version you are only able to login with hardcoded credentials:

                    -username: "user123"
                    -password: "ibuEDU123."

In the final version user will be able to register themselves and login with their own credentials.

Also folders and format of the project will not keep the same shape, and they will be organized in a more fitting manner.
